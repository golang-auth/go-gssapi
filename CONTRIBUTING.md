## Community guideliens

We believe that open source thrives on respectful collaboration and a diversity of perspectives.  This
leads to better solutions, more creativity, and a more engaging project.
We welcome and value all contributions — whether they are code, documentation, ideas, or feedback. Your time and expertise are deeply appreciated.  We don’t enforce rigid style guides or lengthy rules of conduct, but keep
some simple guidelines in mind:

 * **Be Respectful**: We ask for mutual respect and professionalism in all interactions. 
   Challenge ideas thoughtfully and be open to new viewpoints.
 * **Substance Over Perfection**: We value contributions even when they are not perfect. The project’s
   maintainers may suggest changes for clarity or consistency, but our primary focus is on the substance of your contribution.
 * **We Can Help**: If you are short on time, maintainers can assist with minor amendments to help get
   your work merged. Our goal is to create a welcoming atmosphere where contributors, including those who are less experienced, feel supported.
