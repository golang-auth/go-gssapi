Package gssapi provides a Go interface to the Generic Security
Services Application Program Interface.

The package defines an interface that GSS-API mechanism specific
code should conform to.

An Initiator (ie. client) uses the Initiate method to start the
authentiation process.  An Acceptor (ie. server) uses the Accpet
method instead.  After that, both sides call Continue in a loop,
transferring token between themselves using a suitable communication
protocol.  When IsEstablished returns true, the security context
can be used to securely transfer messages or message signatures using
Wrap/Unwrap or MakeSignature/VerifySignature.

	// IsEstablished can be used to determine whether the security
	// context between an Initiator and Acceptor is complete and
	// is ready to transfer messages between the peers.

	// the initiator and acceptor.  The flags *SHOULD* be checked
	// before using the context to verify that desired security
	// requirements have been met.

	// PeerName returns a string representing the peer's identity
	PeerName() string

	// requestedOutputSize bytes

	// Initiate is used by a GSS-API Initiator to start the
	// context negotiation process with a remote Acceptor.

	// Acceptor, and flags represent the desired security
	// properties of the context.

	// to create a token that encapsulates a payload.  If confidentially
	// is required, the payload is encrypted (*sealed*) using a key
	// negotiated during context establishment.  Otherwise, the key
	// is used to sign the payload which is encapsulated in the clear.
	// tokenOut should be communicated to the peer which should use Unwrap
	// on the token.

	// Unwrap is passed a wrap token received from a peer.  If the token

	// to verify the signature that the remote Wrap call calculated for the
	// payload.

	// isSealed conveys whether the payload was encrypted or not
	Unwrap(tokenIn []byte) (tokenOut []byte, isSealed bool, err error)

	// the payload (communicated separately) to verify the signature.
